        My name is Jacobe Wallace. I was born in Dallas, Texas at Children's
        Medical Center in July of 1992. Growing up it was just my mother, my
        older brother and I. Coming from a small family, I was usually quiet and
        to myself. Spending a lot of time drawing or reading. I spent the first
        half of my life in Dallas and then moved to Arlington, Texas where I
        graduated from Mansfield Summit High School. Shortly after, I moved to
        New York where I learned pattern making and some graphic design
        elements. Also while I was in New York I taught myself how to sew and
        embroider. I recently moved back home to Texas because my mother and
        grandmother were diagnosed with COVID and wanted to be closer to home so
        I can help out more. Now I'm starting my first semester at TSTC to learn
        Web Design/Development. It was always something I was interested in and
        I hope I pick up on it quickly.

        Growing up I was always into sports. Basketball, football and track were
        my favorites. When the school season's were over I usually spent my
        whole summers traveling with AAU teams. I've been all across the country
        for tournaments and this took much of my time in my youth. As I got
        older, I started to involve myself in more fashion related things. I
        collect archival clothing from past seasons. It started when I was in
        high school, collecting sneakers and eventually moved on to clothing
        from famous designers. Which is why after highschool I moved to New York
        to learn pattern making, sewing, and graphic design. I'm hoping to take
        what I learn from Web Development and implement it into my passion for
        clothing design. Overall I'm just a laid back guy and I'm trying to
        reach my goals one day at a time.
